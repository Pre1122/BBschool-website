            For many generations, the management has been involved in community services.  
            The forefathers of the management people constructed the "Thayaar" shrine in 
            Thiruvengadamudayan Temple, 
            Ariyakudi.  Later they established a charity in the name of CT.Choultry in Srirangam, 
            Trichy District which is still in existence, for more than 100 years offering free food
            and accommodation to the needy and poor.  Meanwhile, our forefathers owned nearly 2100 Acres of 
            land in Myanmar and lost all these assets due to the emergency situation arouse there.  
            Now, to provide educational service at more standardized and international level, Brindavan
            came into existence.<br/>
